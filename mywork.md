As a science communicator and editorial strategist, I specialize in translating complex scientific and policy issues into compelling, accessible narratives. My work spans federal science agencies, academic research institutions, educational technology companies, and museums.

This page features highlights of my work. Additional samples are available upon request.

### Data-driven narratives
<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://lauracrothers.github.io/assets/SEQUOIA-article.pdf">Profiling cancer with SEQUOIA</a></em>: A plain-language news piece geared towards biologists about a new AI model that can assist with cancer diagnostics.</li>

<li><em><a href="https://lauracrothers.github.io/assets/CellForge-article.pdf">CellForge: Automating virtual cell models with multi-agent AI</a></em>: A plain-language news piece geared towards biologists about a new AI framework that may lower barriers to building and testing models.</li>

<li><em><a href="https://lauracrothers.github.io/assets/DiversityInSTEM_Crothers.pdf">Why the United States needs a more diverse scientific workforce</a></em>: Thought leadership article written to highlight the strategic importance of diversity in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).</li>
</ul>

### Institutional storytelling
<ul>
    <li><em><a href="https://www.nsf.gov/">NSF.gov</a></em>: I oversee the public web program at the National Science Foundation, the nation's premier scientific funding agency — leading content and design for a website that serves 40M+ visitors each year. Some highlights include:
     <ul><li><a href="https://www.nsf.gov/focus-areas">Focus Areas:</a> Explore the agency's funding priorities.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.nsf.gov/impacts">NSF Impacts:</a> Learn how NSF's investments in basic research led to tangible benefits for people's lives.</li>
  <li><em><a href="https://www.nsf.gov/impacts/crispr">CRISPR: A biotech breakthrough</a></em>: Impact piece linking NSF’s investments to real-world biotech transformation.</li></ul>
  </li></ul>


### Human interest stories
<ul>
