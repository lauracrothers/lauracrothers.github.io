  <p>I’m a science communicator and program strategist who helps institutions reach broader audiences and operate more effectively.</p> 

<p>Over the past decade, I’ve led major strategic communications initiatives in federal, academic, and industry settings — including managing NSF.gov, a website serving 40+ million visitors annually.</p> 

<p>With a Ph.D. in biology and 15+ years across the public science ecosystem, I bring cross-functional leadership, deep scientific fluency, and a commitment to compelling and credible communication.</p> 

<p>In my free time you can find me hiking or fiddling with new recipes in the kitchen.</p>
<p>I am always interested in discussing collaborations and future opportunities — especially in roles that connect science, society, and policy.</p>
